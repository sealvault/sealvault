# TLA+ Models

It is recommended to use the [Visual Studio TLA+
plugin](https://github.com/tlaplus/vscode-tlaplus) instead of the TLA+ ToolBox
to work with the models.

Each model has a corresponding file prefixed with `MC` (short for model checker)
that is used to pass configuration values to the model. The model checker should
be executed on these `MC` prefixed `.tla` files.
