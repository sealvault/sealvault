# SealVault Website

## Overview

URL: [https://sealvault.org](https://sealvault.org)

Provides [landing page](https://sealvault.org) and features for end users,
[developer documentation](https://sealvault.org/dev-docs/) for SealVault
developers and the [SealVault blog.](https://sealvault.org/blog/)

Powered by [Material for
MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Development

The landing page and the blog depend on paid features from [Mkdocs Material
Insiders](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/), but you can
work on the developer documentation without these by installing the free version
as documented
[here.](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/)

## Deployment

Pushes to the main branch automatically deploy the website to
[https://sealvault.org](https://sealvault.org) by Netlify.

[Deploy previews](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/deploy-previews/) are
enabled for PRs and branches in the `sealvault/sealvault` repo are automatically
