# Isolated Identities with Profiles

SealVault lets you organize your wallets and dapps into profiles for separate
on-chain identities. The app won't let you send transactions between addresses
in different profiles, but you have to be careful not to link them from an
external wallet. With the upcoming on-ramp integration, you will be able to fund
profile wallets from the app with Apple Pay without connecting them on-chain.
