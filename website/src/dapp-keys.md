# Dapp Keys

When you add a dapp to your profile, a new key can be generated just for this
dapp. This isolation

- mitigates damage from compromised dapps &#129399;
- enables **automated transaction approval** &#129395;

## Dapp Address

A dapp address is just like a wallet address. You can send and receive tokens with it.

## Transfer Funds

SealVault makes it easy to transfer funds between your wallet and dapp
addresses. You can configure sending a small amount of native tokens
automatically to each newly added dapp address for transaction fees.
